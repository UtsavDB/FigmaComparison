## Summary Table

| Component                         | Description of Difference                                                 | Severity | Pixel Deviation   | Recommendation                                                  |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Header Title ("Overview and schedule")** | Position shifted ~6px downward and 6px right; font appears bolder and slightly larger | **Major** | ~6px vertical & horizontal; font weight/size | Align header to match baseline X,Y coordinates; check font size and weight against Figma spec |
| **Section Headings** ("Upcoming tasks", etc.) | Typography and color slightly darker and heavier than baseline              | Minor    | ≤3px, style only  | Acceptable if within brand color and font tolerances             |
| **Action Buttons** (e.g., "Add task") | Button appears 7px higher in baseline; color hue lighter in baseline; Current button border is more prominent | **Major** | 7px vertical, color | Adjust vertical alignment and button color/border to match baseline; verify style per design spec |
| Card Backgrounds                   | Card backgrounds display higher contrast (darker) in Current; larger shadow cast | **Major** | N/A (stylistic/layout)      | Lighten card background and reduce shadow to match Figma         |
| **Task Item Alignments**           | Left padding of first task in card is 5px greater in rendered UI; text not vertically optically centered | **Major** | 5px horizontal, 4px vertical | Restore Figma padding and text vertical alignment specification  |
| **Status Badges** (“Completed”, etc.) | Badge height increased (~4px difference), background hue deeper than Figma | Minor    | 4px vertical, color | Acceptable if contrast remains readable and within tolerance     |
| **Date/Time Text**                 | Font size is rendered 2px larger and 4px to left vs. Figma; weight seems bolder | Minor   | 2px size, 4px pos  | Acceptable if text does not overflow or clash with layout        |
| **Iconography** (Check/Circle icons) | SVGs render ~5px smaller; some icons appear thinner                         | **Major** | ~5px size/weight   | Use Figma-exported SVG assets; ensure icons do not lose clarity/legibility |
| **General Spacing Between Cards**  | Gaps increased by 8px between content cards in Current                      | **Major** | 8px vertical       | Update margins/paddings to match Figma-provided spacing spec     |
| **Scroll Indications (if present)** | Scrollbar uses default browser style; baseline has custom flat scroll thumb | Minor   | N/A               | Acceptable for now unless custom scrollbar is mandatory          |
| **Footer/Bottom Bar** (if any)     | Not present in Current; present in Baseline                                 | **Major** | Layout missing     | Implement Footer/Bottom Bar per Figma, ensuring correct height, color, shadow |

## Final Summary

- **Overall Verdict:** **Fail**
- **Total Minor Deviations:** 4
- **Total Major Deviations:** 6

## Action Items (Prioritized Fixes for All Major Deviations)

1. **Header Position & Font**
   - Re-align the main title to Figma's Y and X coordinates.
   - Cross-check typeface, weight, and size according to design tokens.

2. **Action Buttons**
   - Adjust vertical button alignment and margin.
   - Update color and border to match Figma color palette and style tokens.

3. **Card Backgrounds & Shadows**
   - Soften card background color for higher color fidelity to design.
   - Reduce card shadow blur/spread and opacity to match baseline.

4. **Task Item Alignment**
   - Restore left-side padding per Figma (reduce by 5px).
   - Vertically center text within its container as per baseline.

5. **Iconography**
   - Replace icons with Figma-exported SVGs for visual match.
   - Ensure all icons are the correct size and stroke weight.

6. **Inter-Card Spacing**
   - Update CSS spacing between cards/content to Figma’s 8px smaller gap.

7. **Footer/Bottom Bar**
   - Implement the footer with specified height, background color, and shadow/effects if included in the baseline design.

### Developer/Design Spec Checks

- Confirm token values for spacing, font sizes, and font weights.
- Reimport or validate all vector assets used for icons.
- Use brand color palette for all primary, accent, and status colors.
- Test responsive and overflow scenarios after layout updates.
