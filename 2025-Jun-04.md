## Deviation Table

| Component/Area                         | Description of Difference                                  | Severity | Pixel Deviation / Detail      | Recommendation / Action                                                                                               |
|---------------------------------------- |-----------------------------------------------------------|----------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Page Title ("Overview and Schedule")**         | Title shifted lower and appears bolder in Current UI       | **Major**  | ~6px vertical; increased weight | Align to baseline Y coordinate per Figma; ensure font weight/size matches Figma spec                                   |
| **Section Headings**                            | Spacing above headings increased in Current                | Minor    | 2–3px more vertical space     | Acceptable (within tolerance), but monitor if further spacing increases                                                |
| **Primary Action Button**                        | Button (placement and size) is larger in Current UI        | **Major**  | ~10px taller; ~8px wider      | Adjust button size and coordinates to match Figma; audit button padding, border radius, and text alignment             |
| **Secondary Text (subtitle/description)**        | Font appears thinner and color is less saturated           | Minor    | Color deviation within 4 (hex) | Acceptable unless readability is impaired; check contrast if brand guidelines are strict                               |

| **Iconography/Decorative Elements**              | Calendar icon missing beside title                         | **Major**  | Element absent                | Add missing icon as per Figma; verify icon placement and color                                                         |
| **Tab Navigation**                              | Tabs shifted left; selected indicator is thicker           | **Major**  | Tabs ~10px left; 3px thicker indicator | Move tab component to match grid alignment; adjust indicator thickness; verify active state per Figma                   |
| **Hover/Active States**                         | Table row hover color not matching Figma spec              | Minor    | Slight hue shift              | Acceptable for now, but verify against accessibility standards                                                         |
| **Padding Around Main Content Container**        | Body padding reduced (content closer to edge)              | **Major**  | 12–16px less padding          | Increase outer container padding to Figma values; review breakpoints for responsiveness                                |
| **Footer/Legal Copy**                           | Footer text cut off in Current; not visible                | **Major**  | Text missing / truncated      | Ensure full footer text is present; check if rendering or overflow/visibility issue                                    |
| **General Layout/Alignment**                    | Many elements (buttons, list, tabs) misaligned to grid     | **Major**  | >3px offset in several areas  | Apply Figma layout grid as reference; audit all key block alignments (especially horizontal alignment)                 |
| **Contrast/Color Use for Action Items**          | Primary CTA color lighter than baseline                    | Minor    | ~3 hex difference             | Acceptable unless failing contrast checks; revise if outside design system threshold                                   |
| **Input Fields/Text Fields**                     | No visible deviation                                      | None     | -                            | -                                                                                                                     |

## Final Summary

**Overall Verdict:** **Fail**

- **Total Minor Deviations:** 5
- **Total Major Deviations:** 8

## Prioritized Action Items (Major Deviations Only)

1. **Align Page Title**  
   - Correct vertical alignment; match font size and boldness with Figma spec.

2. **Primary Action Button**  
   - Reduce button height and width to match Figma; confirm text centering and border radius/padding.

3. **Table Layout (Columns and Row Heights)**  
   - Re-align columns and table rows to Figma grid; ensure all table paddings/spacing and row heights meet reference.

4. **Add Missing Icon**  
   - Place the missing calendar icon beside the page title as per Figma.

5. **Tab Navigation**  
   - Shift tabs to match Figma’s left-edge/grid; adjust selected tab indicator thickness to reference.

6. **Main Content Padding**  
   - Increase outside padding/margins on main body container to design spec.

7. **Footer/Legal Copy**  
   - Restore complete footer/legal text—resolve any overflow or visibility issues.

8. **General Layout/Alignment**  
   - Audit grid alignment across all key sections—buttons, tables, tabs—to ensure all match Figma precisely (within ±3px).

## Recommendations

- Enforce pixel-perfect alignment on primary grid-based sections (header, tabs, tables, outer padding).
- Sync component styles (button, table, tab selectors) to design system tokens (font, color, padding).
- Add missing icons or decorative elements per baseline to avoid lose of meaning or brand consistency.
- Conduct responsive checks to ensure improvements do not introduce new layout issues at various screen sizes.
