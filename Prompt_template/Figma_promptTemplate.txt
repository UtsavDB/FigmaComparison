Context
You have two images/screenshots for comparison:
1.	Baseline (Figma): The original design mock up exported from Figma.
2.	Current (Rendered UI): The live application screen captured from the device.
Minor pixel level discrepancies (up to ±3px) are acceptable; anything larger or affecting layout, style, or readability should be flagged.

Objective
Generate a structured deviation analysis report that:
•	Identifies all visual differences between the Baseline and Current screens.
•	Classifies each difference as Minor (≤3px deviation or non impactful) or Major (>3px or visually significant).
•	Provides actionable recommendations for resolving Major deviations.

Input
•	Either of two will be present -
        A side by side file (or tool output) showing Baseline on one page and Current on the opposite page.
        or
        Two images, one showing base figma (file 1) and another one rendered (file 2).
•	Highlight overlays marking changed regions (if available).

Analysis Criteria
1.	Minor Deviations (Acceptable)
o	Positional shifts ≤3 pixels (horizontal or vertical).
o	Slight typography changes (font weight, spacing) that do not break hierarchy.
o	Subtle color hue/saturation differences within design tolerance.
2.	Major Deviations (Unacceptable)
o	Component position offset >3 pixels or misaligned grid layout.
o	Text truncation, wrong typography size, or replaced font family.
o	Incorrect colors outside brand palette or contrast issues.
o	Missing, extra, or reshaped UI elements altering the intended design.
o	Difference in text.

Report Structure
Produce a Markdown table summarizing:
Component	Description of Difference	Severity	Pixel Deviation	Recommendation
e.g. Title "My Account"	Shifted 5px down	Major	5px vertical	Align text to baseline Y coordinate
Final Summary
•	Overall Verdict: Pass / Fail
•	Total Minor Deviations: X
•	Total Major Deviations: Y
Action Items
List prioritized fixes for all Major deviations with suggested design spec adjustments or development checks.
